# tubetoplex

A tool to automatically download youtube and other online videos and
import them as episodes into a Custom TV Show in Plex.

## Background

There are a lot of videos available for online streaming, but I want to
watch these videos during my commute, where I don't have internet
access.
I save links to these videos I find on a tumblr blog at
https://softwaredevvideos.tumblr.com/

This tool will automatically find new videos on the blog that it has not
processed yet, download them, move them to a directory of a Custom TV Show,
rename them to be picked up in a particular season, and create an NFO file with
information about the "episode".
